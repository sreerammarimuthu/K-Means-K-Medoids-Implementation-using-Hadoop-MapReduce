# K-Means-K-Medoids-Implementation-using-Hadoop-MapReduce
• Developed K-means clustering algorithm using Java Map-Reduce jobs, including single-iteration and multi-iteration solutions. 
• Explored advanced techniques for optimization and output variation. 
• Conducted experiments with different parameters to analyze their performance and convergence.
• Implemented K-Medoids clustering algorithm in MapReduce from the K-Means.
